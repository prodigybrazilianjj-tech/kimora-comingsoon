      <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
      <p>A few quick answers to the questions we get most from people on the mats, in the gym, and between rounds.</p>

      <div style="text-align:left; max-width:820px; margin:18px auto 0; line-height:1.7;">
        <p><strong>Do I need to “load” Kimora?</strong><br>
        No. Each stick gives you 5 g of creatine monohydrate. Just take one stick every day and let your levels build over time.</p>

        <p><strong>When should I take it?</strong><br>
        Whenever you’ll actually remember it — morning, pre-training, post-training, or with a meal. Consistency matters more than timing.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I stack this with pre-workout or electrolytes?</strong><br>
        Yes. Kimora plays well with others. Just keep an eye on your total sodium intake if you’re using multiple electrolyte products.</p>

        <p><strong>Will creatine make me bloated or “puffy”?</strong><br>
        Creatine can increase muscle cell hydration, but most people notice better performance, not bloat. We use a straightforward 5 g dose, no loading and no sugar.</p>

        <p><strong>Do I have to be a fighter to use Kimora?</strong><br>
        No. Kimora is built with combat sports in mind, but it’s great for lifters, runners, hikers, and anyone who wants more strength, better recovery, and sharper thinking.</p>
